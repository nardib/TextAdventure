The game must be in a graphic environment.

There are # rooms in a map, one player and one enemy moving and interacting in the map

There are objects divided in # main categories: 
- view only
- storable (e.g. memos, sheets, etc.)
- storable and usable (e.g. keys, painkillers and bendages to restore health etc.)
- usable but not storable (e.g. doors, drawers, chests, cabinet, locks, etc.)

There should be a class for processing text inputs through a text field.


Items:
- key
- hammer
- bendages (2 health point restored)
- painkillers (1 health point restored)
- notes
- lock
- chest (void and used to throw away items)
- cabinet
